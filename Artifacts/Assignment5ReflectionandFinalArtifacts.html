I worked in their Research and Development (R&amp;D) department as a library science intern. The only physical location of the Carpenter Library is in R&amp;D, but the digital services extend to all employees in the company. There I worked with my boss, Mindy Peters, the knowledge management specialist, and librarian, Jenna McQue. The library supports the researchers and company innovation by maintaining a vast collection of technical reports, publications, government documents, and books. Over the course of my fieldwork, I was tasked with many responsibilities including cataloging, digitizing, processing materials, and organization of materials to ensure their accessibility for future research. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2">During my time at Carpenter Technologies, my primary focus was on the cataloging and digitization of Latrobe Technical Reports and governmental reports. I started with 3 banker boxes of government reports and 8 boxes of technical reports. As my internship ends September 20, I am on track to complete this main task, but as of today, August 13, I finished the three boxes of government reports, and five boxes of technical reports. In order to accomplish this work, I started by going through government reports and checking for duplicates in our existing knowledge management software, InMagic Presto. If there was a duplicate, it was shredded, and if there wasn&rsquo;t I were to find the digital copy from a government website and catalog it into Presto. If there did not exist a digital copy, I catalogged it physically into the collection. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2">Initially, I expected my work to be largely focused on straightforward cataloging tasks. However, the reality was much more dynamic. The hybrid work format allowed me to balance on-site tasks with remote work, giving me the flexibility to focus on different aspects of my role. While the work was challenging, particularly in understanding the complexities of cataloging technical reports from a different company (Latrobe), it also offered significant learning opportunities.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2">I gained a lot of practical cataloging experience, becoming familiar with different types of items that needed to be cataloged. I cataloged physical items using the Dewey Decimal system and the Cutter System. These skills directly translate to library experience I hope to use in the future. This work was essential in maintaining the integrity and usability of the library&rsquo;s resources. I also contributed to the organization and management of the physical book collection, which involved moving and weeding outdated materials. Additionally, I participated in library training sessions for new hires, attended corporate meetings, and engaged in the company&rsquo;s monthly &quot;lunch and learns,&quot; all of which provided valuable insights into the daily operations of a corporate knowledge management system.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2">I believe I performed well in managing my tasks and adapting to the workflow at Carpenter Technology. My strengths included my attention to detail and ability to work independently, especially in tasks like the book collection move and cataloging. However, I also recognized areas for improvement. I came into this position without any experience, so sometimes I had to ask lots of questions in order to complete a task. I hope now that I gained experience I will be able to use it in the future.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2">One of the main challenges I faced was the complexity of cataloging the Latrobe Technical Reports, which were organized differently than Carpenter&rsquo;s existing system. To address this, I engaged in discussions with my supervisor to develop a consistent approach for cataloging these materials. This collaborative problem-solving process not only resolved the issue but also enhanced my understanding of cataloging practices.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2">The value of this experience lies in the practical skills I developed, particularly in cataloging, digitization, and knowledge management. These are highly transferable skills that I can apply in future roles within libraries or information management. Additionally, my participation in meetings and training sessions provided a broader understanding of corporate operations, which will be invaluable in any professional environment. I also became very close with my boss and coworkers who gave me general advice for the field which I thought was important. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2">My work at Carpenter Technology reflected the iSchool&rsquo;s core values of social justice and equity by contributing to the accessibility of information. The cataloging and digitization work I performed ensures that important knowledge is preserved and accessible to employees. This general preservation of information was also extended with my work in the Carpenter Archives. Although at the time of this reflection I have not completed this work, I know by the time my internship is over, my impact in preservation and organization of historical documents will be known. This also reflects in the initial mapping of my outcomes to my DFW experience. I believe that we were correct in our mappings of student learning outcomes, but everything in my work is so fluid, that a single task maps to so many student learning outcomes. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2">The coursework I completed prior to this fieldwork provided a solid foundation, particularly in cataloging and information management. However, I found that hands-on experience was crucial in applying this knowledge. Looking back, I wish I had taken additional coursework in copyright, as it would have further enhanced my ability to manage the digitization process more efficiently.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2">This DFW experience played a crucial role in my overall program of study. It provided me with the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world setting, bridging the gap between academic learning and professional practice. This experience has solidified my interest in pursuing a career in corporate knowledge management or specialized librarianship. I have been applying to more part time jobs and hope to receive something related to my job this summer soon.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2">In conclusion, my fieldwork at Carpenter Technology was a highly valuable and educational experience. I made good connections with my coworkers, learned practical skills, and reinforced my love for being a librarian. As I continue my journey in the MLIS program, I will carry forward the lessons learned and the skills developed during this fieldwork.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
