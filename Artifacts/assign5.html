The internship lasted ten weeks, requiring ten hours per week. My schedule was pretty set: Tuesdays from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM and Wednesdays from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Because this was a private archive, I can&rsquo;t share many specifics about my work, but my main responsibility was reviewing and cataloging audio-visual media, mostly DVDs, while recording descriptive and technical metadata.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I worked with a wide variety of media, including home videos, professional footage, speeches, and even old broadcast recordings of Indy Car races from ESPN and ABC. My job involved watching and analyzing the content, flagging duplicates, noting inconsistencies, and researching details to improve metadata accuracy. As the internship progressed, I also worked with image and audio files, expanding my experience with different types of digital media. Of course, not everything went perfectly, there were a few technical issues along the way, which I&rsquo;ll talk about later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although my internship didn&rsquo;t have a direct focus on social justice, it still tied into broader themes of inclusion and accessibility. Preserving a family&rsquo;s history ensures that personal stories, ones that might otherwise fade away, are documented and accessible for future generations. Additionally, creating detailed metadata helps make archival materials more searchable and usable. Through discussions with my supervisor, I also gained insight into how different communities approach archival work and the challenges they face in preserving their histories.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Reflection:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Going into this internship, I expected a structured environment where my main focus would be cataloging and entering metadata. While that was largely true, I quickly realized how much problem-solving was involved. For example, one of the DVD drives I was using stopped working, which completely disrupted my workflow. I had to troubleshoot the issue and coordinate with IT to find a solution. Similarly, I ran into media formats that weren&rsquo;t playing correctly or had incorrect metadata, so I had to do my own research to figure out what was going on.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Self-Evaluation:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think one of my biggest strengths during this internship was my attention to detail. I was able to spot patterns in content and metadata inconsistencies that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. Organization and analytical thinking also played a big role in my work, helping me improve the accuracy and usability of the archival records. When I ran into unfamiliar media formats, I wasn&rsquo;t afraid to ask questions or do research on my own, which helped me learn a lot along the way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That said, I definitely struggled with some of the technical aspects, particularly when DVDs displayed incorrect time durations or wouldn&rsquo;t play properly. While I did my best to research solutions, my limited background in digital media processing meant that I often had to rely on external help. Moving forward, I&rsquo;d like to build my technical knowledge in media preservation so I can troubleshoot these kinds of issues more independently.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Challenges:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the biggest challenges I faced was dealing with DVDs that had incorrect metadata: wrong titles, missing content, and playback errors. To address this, I developed a system where I cross-referenced physical labels, playback data, and technical metadata from VLC Media Player. I also kept a running document of common issues and solutions, which should help future interns working on similar projects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another tricky situation was when I came across an entire box of discs containing files with no file extensions. The computer couldn&rsquo;t read them at all. After some trial and error (and help from IT), we discovered that manually changing the file type to JPG allowed the images to be viewable. Since there were hundreds of files, we used a command line function to batch modify them. The command we used was: ren *. *.jpg. This saved us an incredible amount of time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And honestly, the biggest challenge? Getting sick. This internship was pretty short, so I really didn&rsquo;t want to miss time, but in the middle of it, I caught a bad cold and had to take time off. Then, near the end, I got food poisoning. Since remote work wasn&rsquo;t an option, I missed a few days and decided to extend my internship by an extra week to make up for the lost hours. Even though getting sick was frustrating, I was committed to completing my hours and making the most of this experience.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Skills Learned:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">This i</span><span class="c1">nternship gave me hands-on experience with several archival skills, including:</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_9011jpbpt5gi-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Metadata Creation &amp; Management: Improving descriptive and technical metadata for better searchability.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Problem-Solving &amp; Research: Investigating discrepancies and troubleshooting technical issues in media formats.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Data Organization &amp; Documentation: Keeping structured records of archival inconsistencies and best practices.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Collaboration &amp; Communication: Working with my supervisor and IT to solve problems and refine workflows.</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These skills are directly applicable to future library and archival work, especially in digital preservation and information organization. Plus, learning how to troubleshoot technical media issues will definitely help me when dealing with digital collections and format migration challenges down the road.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Connection to iSchool Core Values: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This internship aligned well with the iSchool&rsquo;s core values, especially in terms of accessibility and archival stewardship. By organizing metadata, I contributed to making information more retrievable for the future. My experience also reinforced the importance of archival practices, which I first learned about in my metadata and digital preservation coursework. Getting to apply these concepts in a real-world setting made me appreciate their significance even more.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Final Thoughts: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Overall, this internship was an incredibly valuable experience that gave me deeper insight into archives, digital preservation, and metadata management. It also highlighted the importance of adaptability and problem-solving in an archival setting. I walk away from this experience with a stronger foundation in metadata creation and a better understanding of the complexities of digital media preservation, both of which will be instrumental as I continue my studies and transition into a professional role in library and information science.</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
