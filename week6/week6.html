                    <p>
                       This week I continued to go through a box of DVDs and transcribing their metadata and flagging duplicates. Since I have gotten into a groove and begun to recognize material and understand, I also wanted to start my write up of notes and explanations for some of the common issues, problems, and situations that I have encountered. The following are those notes with information redacted due to privacy.

The following are notes and clarifications for understanding the metadata I’ve recorded in the Excel spreadsheet.  

 

For the [Redacted]

Video Title  

Not all Video Titles match up with the title printed on the DVD spine. Lots of DVDs had more information written on the Disc itself, so I added that to the title in the Excel spreadsheet for better keyword searching. However, I wrote the DVDs in the order they are in the box, so it should be easy to find out which DVD the video is referring to.  
When a title has “Part” in it, it is in reference to a DVD case holding two discs OR if the same title stretches across multiple DVDs.  
When a time duration is marked n/a there is typically a few reasons  

The video is unplayable, in which there will be a combination of “n/a” under time duration and “No” under is Video Playable.  
This does not mean that the video content is lost. This usually only happens to the first VTS file – VTS_01_1. When playing the footage from VTS_01_0, which brings up the DVD playing menu and allows the entirety of the video to be played (usually 1-2 hours) the footage that is unplayable and unknown from the VTS_01_1 file plays perfectly fine. So, you can backtrack by adding up the time duration from the rest of the VTS files and subtracting it from the total playability of the video and figure out how much content was missing.  
I write this note to make sure it is known that the content is not lost. Though I am unsure how you would transfer the data out, or why it is inaccessible in one way but not the other.  
Additionally, this problem seems to occur most commonly when the bitrate of the video is in the 4000kbps, with marking the first (unplayable VTS) with a bitrate in the 9000kbps. I do not know why this happens. Occasionally, this problem does occur with all the videos having 6380kbps bitrate, and that confuses me even more.  
The time duration listed in the VLC Media Player seemed suspicious to me. Because each file can only be 1GB large, most of the 6380kbp bit rate with 720x480p video comes out to about 30 minutes. So, when the time duration is listed as 8+ hours long when I know this is impossible. And then, right clicking on the VOB file to look at the properties shows an equally improbably time duration (usually mismatching with the one that shows when the video is playing)  
The video typically plays perfectly fine.  
At the time of writing this, 2/11/2025 I don’t necessarily have a reason for this. I’ve done some research as to why this is happening, and online it just says that DVDs were made for playing on a TV in a player and not meant to be accessed through a desktop computer. When a VOB file is forced to be split, usually in around 1GB of data, it is imperfect and can jumble metadata. Why do VOB files sometimes report incorrect running times? - Doom9's Forum 
Notes 

 In my notes category, there will be several types of notes. As I’ve done more research while viewing and gotten more familiar with the content, I’ve tried to add notes to give more context to the video. Whether that means adding more information that was in the video that helped me search for and find information that confirmed it was a movie or documentary available online. For broadcast television, notes are minimal. There is typically enough information from the title to tell or not enough information overall for me to be more specific on the broadcast. 
There have been some DVDs that are blank or without content. Those can be found by searching for “blank” Additionally, there are some DVDs where I believe they contain duplicate content. Those can be found by searching for “duplicate.”  
There are a lot of discs that hold the same video start in them relating to [Redacted] content. However, the videos have slightly different titles and are wildly different in length. As I am not sure how many different versions were made, I cannot tell how many true duplicates are.  
Switching to [Redacted]

For the first time, the bit rate is 9556kbps. The video plays. The other videos in this box all have varying bitrate.   
Lots of these DVDs have their videos sorted into different BUP / IFO Files, with an easy to access menu. The menu screen allows you to choose which file, and even has more title information, which I have been adding to the notes section. Also, if I click on the files from the file explorer, none of the time durations are there, so to get them, I navigate within the media player to different sections, and it works well that way.  
 

As I wrote these notes I became more confident in the work I was doing was going to be helpful to the archive and make an impact.
