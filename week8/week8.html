                        It's strange to think that this is the last entry in my summer field work. Because I have 5 more weeks left for my internship, 
                        I wasn't really thinking this was the end. However, it is for the directed field work. As I begin to try and wrap my thoughts up for this class, I realize I've already learned so much.
                        Additionally, because I am the only intern at Carpenter Technology who is on the quarter system, I am presenting my end of internship presentation next week with the last group of semester students, a month before my actual ends.
                        So, in a way, this is helpful for me to wrap my thoughts around for that as well. 
                    </p>

                        My accomplishments are as follows: For cataloging, I catalogged close to 200 technical reports, 40 phyical items, 30 publications, 57 government reports. I learned a variety of catalogging methods and types. Solidifying my understanding of the Dewey Decimal System.
                        I also shifted the entire book coolection, weeding 61 books from the collection. I have just begun the archive room work, and plan to have an impact by the end of my internship, even if I haven't done much by the end of this class. 
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, I learned so much so far, and I'm happy to have written this blog to update and keep track of my progess. 
                        Thanks for being here with me and following me on my journey. 
                    </p>
