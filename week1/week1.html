                       Welcome to week 1 of 10 of my blog posts for my Private Family Archive Internship. 


This internship is with a Private Family Archive and I’m working with my mentor, Ryan Donaldson. The internship is 10 weeks long with 10 hours per week of time: 9am-4pm on Tuesdays and 9am-12pm on Wednesdays. 


On the first day of my internship, January 7th, 2025, I was first given an introduction to my internship and a tour of the facility. For my internship, privacy surrounding the Family Archive is the main priority. So, I won’t be able to share many details of my work. 


In the words of the job description, the following will be my tasks. “Responsibilities include reviewing audio-visual optical disc media; recording descriptive and technical metadata; checking if the audio-visual materials are uploaded to the digital asset management system; and then either documenting if the content is already captured in the system or creating a new stub record for staff to later complete.” 


So far, I’ve begun reviewing audio-visual disc media in the form of DVDs. The DVDs include a variety of content including recordings of broadcasted television, such as many Indy Car races from ESPN and ABC as well as documentaries and other private personal family content like birthday parties and speeches. I recorded metadata around the content and playability of these videos such as title, video duration, video size and more. Some of the videos I have come across so far include duplicates as well as discrepancies of the metadata. I will explain more about this in the future as I look toward solutions and understand the patterns better. 


It’s been interesting so far to learn a new type of librarianship work and start this internship. I am excited to work at this Private Family Archive and look forward to updating you in the coming weeks!
